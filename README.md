### Hey 👋

Thank you for visiting my profile. I have nothing outstanding to show yet, but I hope it will appear soon. I'm just taking my first steps in learning Data science. I would appreciate any help. Always happy to chat with someone from that sphere, especially if you are good at this.👀

Feel free to send me some links that you found helpful in the beginning of your path in data science.🎓
